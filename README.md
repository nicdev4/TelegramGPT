# TelegramGPT
 ChatGPT bot in Telegram

# How to use?
To install the bot you will need the aiogram and openai libraries. Installation instructions can be found here:
> https://docs.aiogram.dev/en/latest/install.html
> https://github.com/openai/openai-python

Before starting, install the libraries and change the data for the bot to work with your own (Telegram token, openai key). After this, the bot will start.

**Warning** Excessive use of the API may result in suspension of your OpenAI account. Use the bot at your own risk.
